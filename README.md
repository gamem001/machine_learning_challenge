# Machine Learning Practice - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset will be created.

Each model follows general ML steps:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

### Reporting

* Comparison of each model's performance: 
  
* Summary of findings:
  
* Assumptions based on "best-fit" model:
  *  Is the model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? 
  
  *  What would make the model be better at predicting new exoplanets?
